1. What command did you use to create a ROS package?

The command i used:

`catkin_create_pkg turtlesim rospy geometry_msgs`



2. Why and how did you use ROS messages?

I used the geometry_msgs/Twist message type 
- to publish velocity commands

I did the ROS messages in my program. Twist has two components: linear and angualr velocity. I published Twist messages to the topic /tutle1/cmd_vel to control turtle movement

I launched the roscore by using the terminal code below :

Terminal 1: roscore

Terminal 2: rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

Terminal 3: rosrun lab3_turtlesim turtle_controller.py turtle1

There are various methods to verify messages being published. Option A: run : rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
Option B: run : rostopic list
Option C: run : rostopic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
Option D: run : rqt_graph
Option E: check : roslog
